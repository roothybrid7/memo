= cap-rightscale

Capistrano extension that maps RightScale parameters to Roles
[RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com)

== Installation

Install the packages

For Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ apt-get install ruby ruby-dev rubygems

For RHEL5 (probably needs the EPEL repository enabled):

    $ yum install ruby ruby-devel rubygems

For MacOSX(MacPorts):

    $ port install ruby rb-rubygems


Install the cap-rightscale:

    $ gem install cap-rightscale

== Settings

To prepare, go info the root directory of that project and run capify:

    $ cd <project_dir>
    $ capify .

Configure Capfile(example deploy.rb):

    # config/deploy.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'cap-rightscale'
    require 'cap-rightscale/recipes'

    DEPLOYMENT_ID = 12345       # RightScale Deployment ID
    SERVER_ARRAY_ID = 6789      # RightScale ServerArray ID

    # set roles
    nickname :web, :name_prefix => "proxy", :deployment => DEPLOYMENT_ID
    server_array :app, :array_id => SERVER_ARRAY_ID
    tag :dbm, :tags => "xx_db:role=master", :deployment => DEPLOYMENT_ID
    tag :dbs, :tags => "xx_db:role=slave", :deployment => DEPLOYMENT_ID, :no_release => true

Put RightScale API Credential file into <tt><HOME>/.rsconf/rsapiconfig.yml</tt>

    # <HOME>/.rsconf/rsapiconfig.yml
    username: user@example.com
    password: yourpassword
    account: 1

Run testing:

    $ cap rs:none

=== Roles

In order to define role, RightScale nickname and deployment mappings:

    nickname :web, :name_prefix => "proxy", :deployment => 12345
    # => role :web, ["proxyXXX", ... in deployment ID:12345]

ServerArray mappings:

    server_array :app, :array_id => 6789, :backup => true
    # => role(:app, :backup => true) { ["apXXX", ... in serverarray ID:6789] }

Machine tags and deployment mappings:

    tag :dbm, :name_prefix => "db", :tags => ["xx_db:env=prod", "xx_db:role=master"], :deployment => 12345, :primary => true
    # => role(:dbm, :primary => true) { ["dbXXX", ... in deployment ID:12345] }

=== RightScale API Credential

see the below site:

{Authentication}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/03-RightScale_API/RightScale_API_Examples/Authentication] - RightScale Cloud Management Support Portal

You must authenticate to use the RightScale API, Make sure to set your own login/password(used to login to RightScale dashboard) and account number(the tail end of the Dashboard URL: Settings > Account)

Put Authentication file described in RightScale API credentials into <tt><HOME>/.rsconf/rsapiconfig.yml</tt>

Or, You can define filepath:

    # config/deploy.rb
    set :rs_confpath, "/project/config/rs_auth.yml"


=== Caches

These functions require RightScale api calls, which are slow. On the first call, Write a cache file in the temp directory.
Default cache lifetime is 86400 seconds(1day) each role.

modified cache life time:

    # config/deploy.rb
    set :rs_lifetime, 86400 * 7  # 1week


This can be disabled with ENV variable: <tt>RS_CACHE=false</tt> , <tt>set :rs_lifetime 0</tt> OR <tt>rs_disable :use_rs_cache</tt> in the Capfile.

    $ cap invoke COMMAND='hostname' RS_CACHE=false

    # disable cache config/deploy.rb
    set :rs_lifetime 0
    # the other way
    rs_disable :use_rs_cache

Conversely, to use cache to infinity with <tt>set :rs_lifetime -1</tt>.

    # config/deploy.rb
    set :rs_lifetime -1

Cache clear task(needs after modifying the Capfile):

    $ cap rs:cache:clear
    $ cap rs:cc

=== Server name to associate with the role

Default name is Amazon EC2 local IP address, This can be changed according to the parameter.

Use EC2 public IP address:

    # config/deploy.rb
    rs_enable :use_public_ip


Use RightScale nickname(use as name to resolve for host in <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> or dns record entry).
This takes priority over ip address.
Using RightScale Nickname, How to DNS hostname for ec2 instances:

    # config/deploy.rb
    rs_enable :use_nickname         # RightScale nickname
    set :rs_domain, "ec2.int.com"   # set subdomain managed by your dns server zone(option: default ref <tt>search</tt> in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>)

    # set domain each role(priority over <tt>set :rs_domain</tt>)
    nickname :web, :nickname => "lb", :domain => "ec2.com"

=== Validate

Using ping and name resolv, validate host(except invalid host).

* <tt>rs_enable :validate_echo</tt>: In case you want to except hang-up instance
* <tt>rs_enable :validate_resolv</tt>: In case you want to except host can not be resolved


    # config/deploy.rb
    rs_enable :validate_echo, :validate_resolv

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
